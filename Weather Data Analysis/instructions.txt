Weather Data Analysis Instructions and Requirements

1. Requirements:
   - Python (>=3.6)
   - Python libraries: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn

2. Dataset:
   - The analysis is performed on the 'weather.csv' dataset. Ensure that this CSV file is in the same directory as the Python script or provide the correct file path in the code.

3. Running the Python Script:
   - Save the Python code in a '.py' file (e.g., 'weather_data_analysis.py').
   - Open your terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to the directory containing the Python script.

4. Install Required Libraries:
   - If you haven't already installed the required libraries, you can do so using pip:
     ```
     pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
     ```

5. Execute the Python Script:
   - Run the Python script with the following command:
     ```
     python weather_data_analysis.py
     ```

6. Analysis Steps (as covered in the script):
   - Data Exploration: Display information about the dataset.
   - Data Visualization: Create pair plots to visualize relationships between numeric variables.
   - Feature Engineering (if needed): Modify or create features as required.
   - Data Analysis: Calculate statistics or relationships for specific columns.
   - Data Visualization (Part 2): Create additional visualizations for insights.
   - Advanced Analysis: Perform more complex analyses or predictions (e.g., Rainfall prediction using Linear Regression).
   - Conclusions and Insights: Provide conclusions and insights based on the analysis.

7. Customize the Script:
   - You can customize the analysis steps, add more features, or modify the script to suit your specific requirements.

8. Save or Display Results:
   - The script provides results through the terminal or command prompt. You can also export results to a report or presentation.

9. Additional Work (Optional):
   - Consider additional analyses or improvements as part of your future work.

Please make sure you have Python and the required libraries installed before running the script. Adjust the code as needed for your analysis goals.
